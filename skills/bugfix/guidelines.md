# Bugfix Workflow

Systematic bug resolution through these phases:

1. **Assess** (`/assess`) — Read the bug report, explain understanding, propose a plan
2. **Reproduce** (`/reproduce`) — Confirm and document the bug
3. **Diagnose** (`/diagnose`) — Identify root cause and impact
4. **Fix** (`/fix`) — Implement the solution
5. **Test** (`/test`) — Verify the fix, create regression tests
6. **Review** (`/review`) — *(Optional)* Critically evaluate fix and tests
7. **Document** (`/document`) — Release notes and documentation
8. **PR** (`/pr`) — Submit a pull request
9. **Feedback** (`/feedback`) — Address PR review comments

The workflow controller lives at `skills/controller.md` (interactive) or
`skills/unattended.md` (unattended).
Phase skills are at `skills/{name}.md`.
Artifacts go in `.artifacts/bugfix/{issue}`.

## Principles

- Show code, not concepts. Link to `file:line`, not abstract descriptions.
- If something is broken, say so — don't minimize or hedge.
- If uncertain, flag for human decision — never guess.
- When you're wrong, admit it quickly and course-correct.
- Don't assume tools are missing. Check for version managers (e.g. `uv`, `pyenv`, `nvm`) before concluding a runtime isn't available.
- **Be thorough and complete**: When fixing bugs involving states, phases, or conditions, search the codebase to identify the complete set of possible values. Don't assume you know all variants. When features interact (e.g., polling + pagination), research and understand their interactions before implementing.

## Hard Limits

- No direct commits to `main` — always use feature branches
- No token or secret logging — use `len(token)`, redact in logs
- No force-push, hard reset, or destructive git operations
- No modifying security-critical code without human review
- No skipping CI checks (`--no-verify`, `--no-gpg-sign`)

## Safety

- Show your plan before executing
- Indicate confidence: High (90-100%), Medium (70-89%), Low (<70%)
- Flag risks and assumptions upfront
- Provide rollback instructions for every change

## Quality

- Follow the project's existing coding standards and conventions
- Zero tolerance for test failures — fix them, don't skip them

## Escalation

Stop and request human guidance when:

- Root cause is unclear after systematic investigation
- Multiple valid solutions exist with unclear trade-offs
- An architectural decision is required
- The change affects API contracts or introduces breaking changes
- A security or compliance concern arises
- Confidence on the proposed solution is below 80%

In **unattended mode** (`skills/unattended.md`), "stop and request human
guidance" means writing an escalation report to the artifact directory
and terminating. See the Escalation section in `skills/unattended.md`.
Note: retry-limit exhaustion in unattended mode degrades gracefully
rather than triggering escalation — see `skills/unattended.md` for
details.

## Example Session

```text
User: "Fix issue #421 — NullPointerException on login"

/assess    → reads bug report, proposes plan (inline; no artifact)
/reproduce → confirms the failure with a test
             → writes .artifacts/bugfix/421/reproduction.md
/diagnose  → traces root cause to AuthService.java:87
             → writes .artifacts/bugfix/421/root-cause.md
/fix       → adds null-check, minimal diff
/test      → regression test passes ✓
             → if tests fail: stop and report; offer retry of /fix or escalation
/pr        → pushes branch, creates draft PR
```

## Working With the Project

This workflow gets deployed into different projects. Respect the target project:

- Read and follow the project's own `AGENTS.md` files
- Adopt the project's coding style, not your own preferences
- Use the project's existing test framework and patterns
- When in doubt about project conventions, check git history and existing code
